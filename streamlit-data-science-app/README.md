# Streamlit Data Science App

This project is a Streamlit application designed for data science tasks, including downloading datasets from Kaggle, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and selecting machine learning models for regression and classification tasks. The application follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and implements logging throughout the codebase.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used in the project.
- **logs/**: Contains logs generated by the application.
- **models/**: Contains machine learning models and their results.
- **results/**: Stores results from model training and evaluation.
- **src/**: Contains the source code organized into controllers, models, views, and utilities.
- **main.py**: The entry point of the application.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Features

- **Dataset Management**: Download datasets from Kaggle and manage their storage.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform EDA using libraries such as ydata, dtale, and sweetviz.
- **Model Selection**: Choose and train regression and classification models.
- **User Interface**: A sidebar for functionality selection and main views for EDA and model results.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging to track application behavior and errors.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd streamlit-data-science-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Kaggle API credentials to enable dataset downloads.

4. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the sidebar to navigate between different functionalities of the application.
- Follow the prompts to download datasets, perform EDA, and select models for training.
- Check the logs in the `logs/` directory for any issues or information regarding the application's execution.
