# Logging Structure and Accessing Logs

This directory contains logs generated by the Streamlit Data Science App. The logging system is designed to help track the application's behavior and diagnose issues.

## Logging Configuration

The logging is configured in the `src/utils/logger.py` file. It sets up the logging format, level, and output file. The logs are saved in a structured format to facilitate easy access and analysis.

## Accessing Logs

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory. You can find the following types of logs:

- **Application Logs**: General information about the application's execution, including startup messages and user interactions.
- **Error Logs**: Detailed error messages that occur during the application's runtime, which can help in debugging issues.

To view the logs, simply open the relevant log file in this directory. Each log entry includes a timestamp, log level, and message, making it easy to trace the application's flow and identify any problems.
