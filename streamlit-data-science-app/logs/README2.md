# Machine Learning Models Documentation

This directory contains the implementation of various machine learning models used in the Streamlit Data Science App. The models are designed for both regression and classification tasks, allowing users to select and train models based on their datasets.

## Model Overview

- **Regression Models**: These models are used to predict continuous outcomes. The implementation includes popular algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

- **Classification Models**: These models are used to predict categorical outcomes. The implementation includes algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

## Model Selection

Users can select models through the Streamlit interface, which provides an intuitive way to choose the desired model type and configure its parameters.

## Training and Evaluation

Once a model is selected, users can train the model on their dataset. The results of the training process, including performance metrics, are saved for later review.

## Future Enhancements

Future updates may include the addition of more advanced models, hyperparameter tuning options, and integration with automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks.
